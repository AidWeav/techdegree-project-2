Basketball STATS

The code displays two options which either display team stats or quit the program.
If the user chooses the first option it will continue and ask them their input
on which team to select.
If the user chooses the second it quits..
Once the user has chosen dispaly stats and the team they want, the code will
show the the name, # of players, and the players chosen randomly.
The user will be given a prompt to continue by pressing 'ENTER' and when they do
it will quit the program.
